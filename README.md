## Rationale 
In the digital age it is easier than ever for normal individuals to have a voice and share their opinions, which means more so than ever, the voice of the masses can not only sway once seemingly unmoveable individuals or institutions, but it can often be a predictor or litmus test for change both at large and in insular communities. There is interesting information in the 'vibes' of the people that be obfuscated by individual biases or opinion, so a tool to quantify the sentiments of social media users in a categorical way could be useful.
